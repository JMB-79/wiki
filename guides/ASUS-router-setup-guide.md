# Introduction

ASUS manufacture and supply a wide range of different router models, thankfully they all share similar software and for the purposes of this guide, the basic setup
will be the same. 
If, by logging into the web GUI it looks like [this](main/images/asus-router-guide-loginpage.png), this guide is for you (Note: The colours may be different on your GUI depending on the model of router.)
This guide assumes that you have switched to Olilo from another ISP, and are able log into the GUI through your browser.
If you don't know how to do this, please refer to [here](https://www.asus.com/uk/support/faq/1005263/), and come back here once you have logged in.

## Basic Setup

Once you're in, select ['WAN'](images/asus-router-guide-wan.png) on the left menu. Depending on which physical network you are using (Openreach, CityFibre, or Freedom Fibre)
the following steps are slightly different. If you are not sure which physical network you are connected to, please refer to emails you have received from Olilo to confirm.

### Openreach

- For 'WAN Connection Type', near the top of the [page](images/asus-router-OR-WAN1.png), select 'PPPoE'.
- Scroll down to ['Account Settings'](images/asus-router-OR-WAN2.png) and input the Username and Password supplied by Olilo.
- The rest of the settings on this page can be left as default.
- Click 'OK' at the bottom of the page to save the settings.

### CityFibre

- For WAN Connection Type, near the top of the [page](images/asus-router-CF-WAN2.png), select 'Automatic IP'.
- Click 'OK' at the bottom of the page to save the settings.
- Select ['LAN'](images/asus-router-LAN.png) on the left menu. 
- Select the ['IPTV'](images/asus-router-CF-IPTV1.png) tab at the top of the page.
- On this [page](images/asus-router-CF-IPTV2.png), for 'Select ISP Profile' select 'Manual Setting'. Three new sections will appear.
- On the 'Internet' line, type '911' next to 'VID'.
- The rest of the settings on this page can be left as default.
- Click Apply at the bottom of the page to save your settings.

### Freedom Fibre

- For WAN Connection Type, near the top of the [page](images/asus-router-CF-WAN2.png), select 'Automatic IP'.
- Click 'OK' at the bottom of the page to save the settings.

### IPv6

- To activate IPv6, select the 'IPv6' [page](images/asus-router-IPv6.png) option in the left menu.
- Select the 'Connection Type' as 'Native'.
- Click Apply at the bottom of the page to save your settings.

## Still Stuck?

Before contacting us:
1. Try to restart the router, once you have followed the above steps and double check the PPPoE login details, if you need to use them.
2. Click on the Network Map tab, toward the top of the left menu to see if the router states if it has connected, and if not, make a note of any error messages.
3. Check the system log, which can be accessed by clicking the 'System Log' tab on the left menu (Second from bottom) make a note of any error messasges.
